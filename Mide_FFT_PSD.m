%[freq, xdft, psdx, phase] = FFT_PSD_Spectrogram(datalist,fActual)
% Given a dataset this will calculate the FFT PSD and phase
%
% Inputs:
%   datalist = two column array with time in first column, data to analyze
%       in second
%   fActual = sample rate of the data in Hertz
%
% Outputs:
%   freq = frequency bins for FFT and PSD
%   xdft = amplitude of FFT in native units of datalist
%   phase = phase response of FFT in radians
%   psdx = amplitude of FFT in native units of datalist squared divided by
%       Hz
